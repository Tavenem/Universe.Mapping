Tavenem.Universe.Mapping
==

Tavenem.Universe.Mapping provides utility classes which facilitate the creation of surface map
images for planets created with the [Tavenem.Universe](https://github.com/Tavenem/Universe) library.

## Installation

Tavenem.Universe.Mapping is available as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Tavenem.Universe.Mapping/).

## Roadmap

Tavenem.Universe.Mapping is currently in a **prerelease** state. Development is ongoing, and breaking
changes are possible before the first production release.

No release date is currently set for v1.0 of Tavenem.Universe.Mapping. The project is currently in a
"wait and see" phase while [Tavenem.Universe](https://github.com/Tavenem/Universe) (a dependency of
Tavenem.Universe.Mapping) is in prerelease. When that project has a stable release, a production
release of Tavenem.Universe.Mapping will follow.
